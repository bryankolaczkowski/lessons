<h1>What is phenotype prediction?</h1>

<h5 class="w3-padding-32 w3-text-grey">
  Predicting how you look and act, based on your genome and environment.
</h5>

<p>
  We all look and act a little differently. We have different heights, hair
  and eye colors, blood types, etc. We also respond differently to our
  environment. We might require different amounts of sleep, have different
  natural energy levels, have allergies to different foods, respond
  differently to pharmaceuticals, etc.
</p>

<p>
  Collectively, how an organism looks and acts can be referred to as the
  organism's "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"
  target="_blank">phenotype</a>". The phenotype generally includes everything
  you can measure about an organism's morphology, physiology and behavior.
</p>

<p>
  There are two major factors that impact an organism's phenotype:
  <ul>
    <li>its genome</li>
    <li>its environment</li>
  </ul>
  An organism's <em>genome</em> is its DNA inherited from its parents and
  modified by mutations. Its <em>environment</em> is everything else.
</p>

<p>
  Typically, we think of the genomic component as the <em>heritable</em>
  factors that impact the way an organism looks and acts. The genome is
  'passed on' (with modification) from parent to offspring. If the genome
  strongly determines a particular aspect of the phenotype (called a "trait"),
  that trait is <em>heritable</em>; it can be 'inherited' from the organism's
  parents.
</p>

<p>
  More 'quantitatively', we can talk about the "heritability" of a phenotypic
  trait - the extent to which the trait is determined by the organism's
  genome. Or, more broadly, the extent to which the child's phenotype is
  'similar to' the phenotype of its parents (after controlling for any
  environmental determination).
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Phenotype prediction</strong> is using information about an
  organism's genome and environment to <em>predict</em> a specific quantitative
  or qualitative aspect of its phenotype.
</p>

<p>
  For example, let's say we'd like to predict a person's height. The
  <em>response</em> variable is "height", a 'quantitative trait' (ie,
  a number). The potential <em>explanatory</em> variables might be the
  person's genome and information about the person's current and past
  environments, such as the country the person grew up in, the person's
  income, information about their dietary and exercise habits, and any
  diseases they may have or may have had in the past.
</p>

<p>
  We can then build a <em>model</em> relating the explanatory variables
  (genome, environment) to the response variable (height). The model is
  just a function:
</p>

<pre class='language-none'>
height = f(genome, environment)
</pre>

<p>
Which can be a simple linear model or any arbitrary function that can be
approximated by a neural network.
</p>

<p>
Given enough 'training examples' (people with known height, genome and
enviornmental variables), we can 'learn' the 'trainable parameters' of
the model.
</p>

<p>
Once trained, we can <em>use</em> the model to predict <em>any</em>
individual's height from their genome and environment.
</p>

<p>
In this example, we used <em>both</em> the genome <em>and</em> the environment
to predict an individual's phenotype. This would be a case of 'general'
phenotype prediction.
</p>

<p>
In many cases, researchers are interested in predicting the phenotype using
<em>only</em> the organism's genome; this is sometimes called "genomic
prediction" (which is maybe weird, because we are <em>not</em> trying to
predict the genome!).
Phenotype prediction using <em>only</em> the genome is typically much more
straight-forward than trying to deal with data about the individual's
environment, which can be complex and difficult to measure and analyze
effectively.
Predicting an organism's phenotypic traits from
its genome has <em>many</em> important applications throughout the agricultural
and life sciences.

<h1>How is phenotype prediction used?</h1>

<h5 class="w3-padding-32 w3-text-grey">
  In medical research, agriculture and basic biology.
</h5>

<h2>Medical Research</h2>

<p>
  There are two primary applications of phenotype prediction in the biomedical
  sciences
  <ul>
    <li>disease risk prediction</li>
    <li>personalized medicine</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Disease risk prediction</strong> is the prediction of an individual's
  risk for developing a particular disease, based on the person's genome.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Personalized medicine</strong> is the tailoring of medical treatment
  to the individual patient.
</p>

<h2>Agriculture</h2>

<p>
  The most common use of phenotype prediction in the agricultural sciences is
  the selection of individuals for use in plant and animal breeding programs.
  Often called "genomic selection",
  the 'phenotypic trait' we would like to predict here is essentially
  'utility in a particular breeding program'. Of course, this phenotype will
  vary greatly, depending on the particular goals of the breeding program!
  What we'd like to accomplish is, given a particular breeding goal and
  potential individuals to use in the breeding program, we'd like to select
  the 'best' individuals to accomplish the goals of the breeding program
  'most efficiently'.
</p>

<p>
  When the trait we'd like to select for in our breeding program has a very
  simple genetic basis (ie, it is controlled by a very small number of
  genes), we can easily use traditional breeding methods or transgenic
  approaches to 'transfer' the genes controlling the trait from one individual
  to another, thereby 'transferring' the phenotypic trait.
</p>

<p>
  But for many complex phenotypic traits controlled by a <em>very</em> large
  number of genes, it may be difficult or <em>impossible</em> to even
  determine <em>which particular genes</em> impact the trait of interest,
  let alone effectively 'transfer' the trait from one individual to another.
</p>

<p>
  By building a <em>model</em> that can predict an individual's phenotype from
  its genome, breeders are able to 'screen' individuals for traits of interest
  <em>very rapidly</em> using <em>only</em> their genome sequences. This
  approach can <em>radically</em> speed up plant and animal breeding programs,
  producing new lines with complex desirable traits without having to
  painstakingly investigate the specific genetic basis for the traits of
  interest.
