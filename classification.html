<h1>What is object classification?</h1>

<h5 class="w3-padding-32 w3-text-grey">
  Labelling data as one of a finite number of categories.
</h5>

<p>
  'Object classification' is one of the key problem domains in which neural
  networks have achieved super-human performance. It is a major focus of the
  AI research community and a 'model problem' used to develop and evaluate
  new AI approaches.
</p>

<p>
  Object classification is a particular <em>type</em> of problem with many
  different applications across a wide variety of disciplines. Object
  classification has been used in handwriting analysis and in business to develop
  AI methods to assist customer searches for specific items. Object
  classification can be used in medicine to identify cancerous vs non-cancerous
  cells, in land-use analysis to identify changes in vegetative cover associated
  with human activities, and in agriculture to identify pest outbreaks.
</p>

<p>
  In general, 'object classification' can refer to any process in which data
  samples are 'labelled' or 'classified' into one or more pre-determined
  categories or 'classes'. For example, an AI system may look at images of
  clothing and determine if the apparel are associated with spring, summer,
  fall or winter wardrobes. Or an AI system may consider images of animals
  and determine the species of animal depicted.
</p>

<p>
  Object classification is commonly associated with image data, because the
  vast majority of AI classifiers have been developed for the purpose of
  labelling images with semantic information. However, object classification
  need not consider only image data; any data about an object can be used
  to classify it using AI.

<h1>How does object classification work?</h1>

<h5 class="w3-padding-32 w3-text-grey">
  Object classification is regression with multiple output neurons.
</h5>

<p>
  Neural networks are composed of modular linear models (aka, "neurons"),
  hooked together with nonlinear activation functions to implement complex
  models capable of approximating any functional relationship between explanatory
  and response variables.
</p>

<p>
  In general, object classification can use <em>any</em> type of neural
  network model, provided the 'shape' of the network's input layer matches
  the 'shape' of the explanatory variables.
</p>

<p>
  In the case of object classification, the 'response variable' is a "categorical"
  variable (also sometimes called a "qualitative" variable), rather than the
  "quantitative" response variables used in regression problems. The response
  variable in object classification problems encodes the specific category or
  "class" to which the data sample belongs.
</p>

<p>
  For example, let's say we have a classification problem in which we want to
  examine image data and determine whether the image is of a cat, a dog or
  a human. In this case, there are 3 different categories: "cat", "dog" and
  "human", and <em>every</em> image must be assigned to one of these
  pre-determined categories.
</p>

<p>
  It is common in nearly all object classification problems that the
  <em>complete</em> list of all possible categories must be determined
  <em>before</em> the analysis, and it is very difficult to <em>extend</em>
  an existing classifier to incorporate <em>new</em> possible categories, after
  it has been trained. In our example, we have a classifier with 3 possible
  categories, so every image we analyze <em>must</em> be an image of either a
  cat, a dog or a human.
</p>

<p>
  How do we encode the categories: "cat", "dog" and "human" in a form that
  computers can 'understand'?
</p>

<p>
  In most cases, categorical variables are encoded as integer values, starting
  at zero (sometimes 1), and ending at the number of possible categories minus 1
  (sometimes the number of categories). So, in our case, we could encode:
</p>

<pre class='language-none'>
cat = 0
dog = 1
human = 2
</pre>

<p>
  Or, alternatively, we could set "cat"=1, "dog"=2 and "human"=3. In general,
  computer scientists typically prefer to start 'counting' things beginning
  with the value zero, whereas professionals in other fields tend to begin
  counting things starting with one, but it really doesn't matter in any
  deep sense.
</p>

<p>
  You'll often see categorical variables encoded as integers in 'human readable'
  data files, but neural networks typically <em>don't</em> encode categorical
  variables this way. There are a few reasons for this; primarily:
  <ul>
    <li>Neural networks typically can't use integers directly; they require
    floating-point numbers.</li>
    <li>Numbers (integers or floating-point) typically imply quantitative
    similarities, which are not necessarily appropriate for categorical
    data. For example, encoding cat=1, dog=2 and human=3 implies that,
    quantitatively, the category "dog" sits 'between' "cat" and "human",
    just because the number 2 is 'between' the numbers 1 and 3. Is this
    appropriate? Should the category 'dog' be equivalent to cat+1?</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  In many cases, categorical variables are encoded as what's called
  "one-hot encoding" for neural networks. This is particularly true in the
  case of object classification and is so common that there is a tensorflow
  object that will <em>automatically</em> encode integer class labels as
  one-hot encodings.
</p>

<p>
  A "one-hot encoding" of a categorical variable 'expands' the variable into
  multiple columns in the data matrix, each representing a single possible
  category or class. Each data sample has zero-valued entries for <em>every</em>
  possible category <em>except</em> the category to which the data sample
  belongs.
</p>

<p>
  In our example, images can be classified as "cat", "dog" or "human"; there
  are 3 possible classes, so we can create 3 possible 'labels' for our
  images:
</p>

<pre class='language-none'>
label_cat, label_dog, label_human
</pre>

<p>
  An image of a cat would have zero-valued entries for the labels: "label_dog"
  and "label_human", but a one-valued entry for the label: "label_cat":
</p>

<pre class='language-none'>
label_cat, label_dog, label_human
   1          0          0
</pre>

<p>
  The image of a cat would get a one-hot encoding consisting of the 'tuple':
  (1,0,0). An image of a dog would get the one-hot encoding: (0,1,0), and
  an image of a human would be one-hot encoded as: (0,0,1).
</p>

<p>
  With one-hot encoding, the number of possible categories or classes defines
  the <em>output shape</em> of the neural network classifier. In our example,
  there are 3 possible classes ('cat', 'dog' or 'human'), so the one-hot
  encoded output of our neural network should be a rank-1 tensor (ie, a
  "vector") in 3 dimensions. That is, the neural network classifier's output
  layer should have shape:
</p>

<pre class='language-none'>
(3,)
</pre

<p>
  Or:
</p>

<pre class='language-none'>
(None,3)
</pre>

<p>
  if we include the 'batch' dimension.
</p>

<p>
  In general, nearly all object-classification networks use this approach, in
  which the output shape of the network is a vector (rank-1 tensor) with
  dimension equal to the number of possible object classes. This is almost always
  implemented as a "dense" neural-network layer with the number of neurons
  (aka, 'units') equal to the number of object classes (3, in this example).
