<h1>What do I need to know before taking this course?</h1>

<h5 class="w3-padding-32 w3-text-grey">
  You need a tiny bit of <em>either</em>
  <ul>
    <li>computer programming</li>
    <li>statistics</li>
    <li>artificial intelligence</li>
  </ul>
</h5>

<p>
  Artificial intelligence (AI) exists at the interface of computer programming
  and statistics; any experience in either of these fields will be helpful in
  this course. If you have taken an introduction to programming course (in
  college, high-school or online), you will have an easier time with the
  computer programming content in this course. If you have taken an introduction
  to statistics course, you will have an easier time with the basic statistics
  content. If you have taken an introduction to AI course, you will have an
  easier time with the AI content.
</p>

<p>
  You will probably struggle unnecessarily if you have <em>no</em>
  previous exposure to <em>any</em> of these topics. But so long as you
  have at least <em>some</em> minimal experience in at least one of these
  areas, you should be well-prepared for the course material.
</p>

<p>
  Is this course 'easy'? Well, I hope not. I hope this course will be
  challenging, fun and rewarding! In this case, I hope it is
  <em>all three</em>, rather than at least one!

<h1>What will I learn in this course?</h1>

<h5 class="w3-padding-32 w3-text-grey">
  You will learn how to use artificial intelligence (AI) like a pro.
</h5>

<p>
  This course teaches you how to design, build and apply neural networks
  for data analysis, particularly focused on applications in the agricultural
  and life sciences. This is a 'hands on' course; you will develop, train
  and evaluate your own AI systems, and you will use your AI to analyze
  real data.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to learning how to program AIs, you will learn what a modern-day
  AI is, how it works, and how to apply 'best practices' during AI development,
  training and evaluation, to make sure your AI is working the way it should.
</p>
<p>
  This course uses the same tools and techniques used by AI professionals
  in a wide variety of fields in both industry and research. We will use
  <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/" target="_blank">tensorflow</a>
  as our AI platform. Originally developed by google, tensorflow is a
  high-performance AI library that is among the most popular libraries
  used by industry and research professionals today.
</p>
<p>
  Although R has reigned supreme as a statistical programming language,
  in AI Python is definitely king. So we'll be using the Python language
  to program our AIs.
  Don't worry if you lack experience with Python, or experience in computer
  programming in general. We'll teach you what you need to know to program
  an AI, and the tensorflow library makes AI programming <em>very</em>
  simple, at least for the 'standard' types of AIs used to solve most
  problems.
