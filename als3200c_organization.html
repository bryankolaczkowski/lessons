<h1>How is this course organized?</h1>

<h5 class="w3-padding-32 w3-text-grey">
  This course is online, asynchronous, with due dates.
</h5>

<p>
  ALS3200C is designed as a standard 3-credit, 1-semester online course
  delivered through UF e-learning. It is organized into 16 weeks of learning
  activities, not including any major breaks during the semester. You should
  expect to spend approximately 9 hours of time on this course every week,
  on average.
</p>

<p>
  To help you schedule your time, we have divided each week's activities into
  3 "days", each of which should take you 3-4 hours to complete. However,
  how you choose to distribute your time across each week is entirely up
  to you. All the quizzes associated with each week's activities are due
  by monday the following week, and you will automatically lose points for
  late quizzes. This course can be completed from anywhere with a stable
  internet connection. You are also free to work ahead as far as you'd like,
  so if you have any major activities planned for this semester, make sure
  you organize your time so you don't miss any due dates.
</p>

<p>
  Each "day's" activities include separate "concepts" and "practical skills"
  tracks, which work together. The "concepts" track focuses on the more
  'academic', 'theoretical'
  or 'informational' side of the material you will be learning. In this track,
  we will be thinking about AI and developing our understanding. The
  "practical skills" track focuses on hands-on activities in which you learn
  how to put your conceptual understanding into practice. In this track, we
  will be programming AIs to perform specific tasks and evaluating their
  performance. I would recommend working through each day's "concepts" track
  first, and then working through the associated "practical skills" track
  for that day.
</p>

<p>
  If you have any questions about course organization, requirements or
  the material you are learning,
  please post a discussion on this course's discussion board in e-learning,
  so other students can benefit from the same answer you receive. If you have
  a personal matter you need to discuss with your instructor, please send me
  a message through the e-learning messaging system. I will try to respond
  to discussion questions and e-learning messages within 24-48 hours. If you
  need an 'office-hour' consultation, please send me an e-learning message
  with a brief description of the consultation topic and 3-4 days+times that
  are convenient for you. Please be aware that I will typically need at least
  48 hours to schedule an 'office-hour' consultation, and virtual 'office-hours'
  through Zoom are preferred for convenience and ease of scheduling.

<h1>How do I navigate this course?</h1>

<h5 class="w3-padding-32 w3-text-grey">
  Everything you need starts on the e-learning course page.
</h5>

<p>
  Everything you need for this course is linked off the course's main page
  in e-learning. From there you can access each of the week's activities
  in both "concepts" and "practical skills" tracks. Each activity includes
  a link to an informational web page that describes
  what you need to know to complete the activity as well as all instructions
  on how to complete the activity. The activity link will open in a new
  browser tab. Each activity also includes a brief quiz assessment, which
  you will need to complete to get credit for the activity. All
  assessments will be done through the e-learning system. You may attempt
  a quiz as many times as you like, and your highest score will count, but
  be aware that you will lose points after the quiz due date.
</p>

<h3>The concepts track</h3>

<p>
  Activities in the "concepts" track consist mainly of information that you
  can read, watch and/or listen to. The quizzes in this track assess your
  basic comprehension of the provided material. I would recommend keeping
  the informational web page open when you take the associated quiz;
  there might be some information there that helps you answer some of the
  quiz questions :)
</p>

<h3>The practical skills track</h3>

<p>
  Activities in the "practical skills" track consist mainly of detailed
  instructions explaining how to do specific programming exercises. Learning
  how to effectively program AI systems using professional-grade tools is
  the primary focus of this course, and that's something you need to learn
  by doing!
</p>

<p>
  Don't worry, we know that most of you are not computer programmers and don't
  want to become computer programmers. But, many of you will someday be working
  as part of a team that includes computer programmers and AI developers.
  The practical experience you gain in this course will help you better
  understand what the computer programmers and AI developers on your team
  are doing and better communicate with them, which will help your team
  function better and produce better results.
</p>

<p>
  In this course, we will provide you with a <em>lot</em> of skeleton
  code, with detailed annotations describing what the code is doing and
  why it is designed the way it is. You will fix and modify existing code
  and write some of your own. Along the way, you should develop a better
  understanding of how AI code works and how to determine if your AI is
  performing the way you would like.
</p>

<p>
  For "practical skills" exercises, I'd recommend fully completing the
  programming exercise before attempting the associated quiz. And make sure
  you leave the completed exercise page open while taking the quiz; you
  are likely to need some program output to answer some of the quiz
  questions! You do know how the copy-paste function works, right :)
