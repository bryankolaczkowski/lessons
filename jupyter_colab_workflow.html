<h1>How do I complete the programming exercises for this course?</h1>

<h5 class="w3-padding-32 w3-text-grey">
  You need to follow an efficient, effective workflow.
</h5>

<p>
  A workflow process is a sequence of activities you can use to complete a
  high-level task. Workflow processes are widely used in business and can
  be very helpful when interacting with computers. Because computers tend
  to think procedurally and have little patience for user errors, having
  an effective process and following it precisely every time can help your
  interactions with computers go much more smoothly.
</p>

<p>
  To complete the programming exercises in this course, you should follow
  the high-level workflow indicated by the following steps:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Log into google colab and access the jupyter notebook for the exercise.</li>
  <li>Follow the instructions in the notebook.</li>
  <li>Critically evaluate your work.</li>
  <li>Fix any errors or problems until there are none.</li>
  <li>Reflect on what you have done and what you have learned.</li>
  <li>Identify any material you don't understand and try it again.</li>
  <li>Ask questions if you still don't understand something.</li>
  <li>Complete the quiz associated with the exercise in e-learning.</li>
  <li>(Optionally) Save your completed jupyter notebook for your records.</li>
  <li>Shut down your jupyter notebook session.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  Now let's put this workflow into practice using an example exercise.
</p>

<div class="w3-threequarter">

<h1>My first course programming exercise</h1>

<h5 class="w3-padding-32 w3-text-grey">
  Follow these instructions to complete this exercise.
</h5>

<ol>
  <li><h3>Log into google colab and access the jupyter notebook for the exercise</h3>

  <p>
    Click on
    <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/bryankolaczkowski/ALS3200C/blob/main/myscrnb.ipynb"
    target="_blank">this link</a>
    to open the jupyter notebook for this exercise in google colab, using
    a new browser tab. The title of this notebook should read "welcome
    to your scratch jupyter notebook".
  </p>

  <p>
    Make sure you are logged in to google colab. You should see your google
    account icon in the upper-right corner of the colab page.
    If you are having trouble logging into google colab,
    <a href="./jupyter_colab_intro.html" target="_blank">this page</a> will
    show you how to do it.
  </p>

  <p>
    For this programming exercise, I'd recommend using three different browser
    tabs:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>the course e-learning page in canvas - so you can easily access the quiz
      afterwards</li>
    <li>this instruction page - so you can check your workflow</li>
    <li>google colab - so you can run the jupyter notebook</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    You will probably also want a fourth tab that you can use to search for
    more information about anything you don't understand or would just like
    to learn a bit more about.
  </p>
  </li>

  <li><h3>Follow the instructions in the notebook</h3>
  <p>
    In google colab, follow the instructions described in the
    jupyter notebook for this exercise. You should read through all the
    material in the
    notebook and complete all exercises.
  </p>
  </li>

  <li><h3>Critically evaluate your work</h3>
  <p>
    Did you understand all the material presened in the notebook?
    Did you successfully complete all the notebook exercises?
  </p>
  </li>

  <li><h3>Fix any errors or problems until there are none</h3>
  <p>
    If you encountered any error messages while completing the jupyter
    notebook, go back and fix them. Repeat until there are no errors
    in your notebook.
  </p>
  </li>

  <li><h3>Reflect on what you have done and what you have learned</h3>
  <p>
    Take a few minutes to reflect on this programming exercise. What were
    the main concepts that were presented? What were the tools or techniques
    that you learned in this exercise? How do you think these concepts,
    tools and techniques might be useful in the future? You might want to
    consider taking some notes while you reflect on this exercise - you can
    write them directly in your jupyter notebook!
  </p>
  </li>

  <li><h3>Identify any material you don't understand and try it again</h3>
  <p>
    Did everything in this programming exercise make sense, or were there
    some concepts, tools or techniques that are still a bit 'fuzzy'? If
    something is unclear, the first thing to do is to go back to your
    notebook and go over the 'fuzzy' material one more time, including
    re-doing any exercises that aren't perfectly clear.
  </p>
  <p>
    Remember that
    fourth recommended browser tab? You can use that to search for more
    information about any concept, tool or technique you aren't comfortable
    with. The internet is a miraculous repository of human knowledge; use
    it to your advantage!
  </p>
  </li>

  <li><h3>Ask questions if you still don't understand something</h3>
  <p>
    Are you still a bit unclear about something from this exercise? If so,
    click on the e-learning browser tab for this course (you know, the
    first recommended browser tab from step #1) and click on the course
    discussions. You can search through the discussions for questions
    similar to yours, or you can start your own course discussion. Your
    instructor actively monitors the course discussion board and is likely
    to respond to your questions within 24-48 hours. Someone else might
    respond a lot quicker!
  </p>
  </li>

  <li><h3>Complete the quiz associated with this exercise in e-learning</h3>
  <p>
    Don't close that google colab tab just yet! You will likely need some of
    the material in your jupyter notebook to answer the quiz questions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Open the course e-learning browser tab and click on the "quiz" link
    next to this exercise. Complete the quiz in e-learning to get credit
    for this programming exercise.
  </p>
  </li>

  <li><h3>(Optionally) Save your completed jupyter notebook for your records</h3>
  <p>
    You don't need to save your completed jupyter notebooks for this course,
    but you might want to save your notebooks, either for your own records,
    for later use, or to save an incomplete notebook to work on later.
  </p>
  <p>
    The easiest way to save a notebook from google colab is to save it to
    your google drive. In google colab, click on the "File" tab in the top-left
    corner, and select "Save a copy in Drive". Google colab will cycle a bit
    and then open a new browser tab with a copy of the current jupyter notebook.
    This copy will be saved to your google drive as "Copy of myscrnb.ipynb"
    (or whatever the original notebook name was). You can rename your copy
    by clicking on the notebook name in the top-left corner of google colab.
    You can find the notebook in your google drive by clicking on the "File"
    tab, selecting "Open notebook" (alternatively, use the keyboard shortcut
    <kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>o</kbd>), and then select the "Google Drive"
    tab, which should list all the jupyter notebooks you have saved to
    your google drive.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are working on a notebook and can't complete it in one session, you
    can always save it to your google drive and then open it later and
    start from where you left off. You don't need to complete the programming
    exercise in a single session for this course, but it is up to you to
    save your own work.
  </p>
  </li>

  <li><h3>Shut down your jupyter notebook session</h3>
  <p>
    Google colab will automatically close your session if it remains inactive
    for a certain period of time. However, it is considered good etiquette
    to <em>not</em> needlessly utilize community resources. So, you should
    <em>always</em> close your colab session when you are finished working
    on your noteboook.
  </p>
  <p>
    To close your colab session, look for a little downward-facing arrow in
    the upper-right corner of google colab. It should be next to a little
    icon that shows "RAM" and "Disk" usage for your session. If there is
    no such icon, you'll probably see the word "Connect" in the upper-right
    corner, with the downward-facing arrow next to it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Click on the downward-facing arrow in the upper-right corner of google
    colab, and select "Manage sessions". You'll see a list of your running
    colab sessions, with the current session indicated. If you have any
    running sessions, you should terminate them by clicking on the "TERMINATE"
    button next to the session. It will take a few seconds to terminate
    a colab session.
  </p>
  <p>
    In google colab, your access to resources is negatively impacted by your
    past resource usage. In other words, if you needlessly use a lot of
    resources, google colab will not give you more resources to use. So, it's
    really important that you terminate your colab sessions when you are
    done. This helps ensure that other users can get the resources they need,
    and it helps ensure that resources are available when you need them!
  </p>

This short video demonstrates how to save a copy of a jupyter notebook to
your google drive in colab, how to open a saved notebook from your google
drive, and how to terminate your colab sessions (steps #9 and #10 from
our workflow process).
