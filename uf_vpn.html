<h1>Why do I need UF VPN?</h1>

<h5 class="w3-padding-32 w3-text-grey">
  The course UNIX server requires it for security reasons.
</h5>

<p>
  In this course, you will be executing arbitrary code on our UNIX server
  over the internet. It is inherently dangerous for our server to allow you
  to do this, as cybercriminals could exploit this service.
  To protect our server, we have set it up to <em>only</em> accept connections
  originating from inside UF's network.
</p>

<p>
  If you are on UF's campus and connected directly to UF's network, you do
  <em>not</em> need to use VPN. However, if you want to connect to our
  server from anywhere else, you must first convince our computer that
  you are actually part of the UF network. VPN allows you to do this, and it is
  <em>required</em> to connect to our server from anywhere except UF campus.
</p>

<h3>What is a VPN?</h3>

<p>
  VPN stands for "virtual private network"; it is a protocol that allows you
  to create a secure connection between your computer and a specific
  'private network' on the internet. Once established, this connection
  effectively makes your computer 'part of' the specified 'private network'.
</p>

<p>
  In this course, you will use UF's VPN client to securely connect your
  computer - wherever it may be - directly to the UF network. This will
  allow you to access our course UNIX server and complete this course
  from anywhere on the planet, provided you have an internet connection.

<h1>How do I get and use the UF VPN?</h1>

<h5 class="w3-padding-32 w3-text-grey">
  You need to download and install UF's VPN client; we'll show you how.
</h5>

<p>
  Click on
  <a href="https://it.ufl.edu/ict/documentation/network-infrastructure/vpn/"
  target="_blank">this link</a>
  to access UF's web page describing the VPN, how it works, and how to
  download, install, configure and run the VPN client. Follow the instructions
  on the UF VPN page, and you should have your UF VPN up and running very
  quickly.
</p>

<p>
  For convenience, I made a short video demonstrating how I downloaded,
  installed and started the UF VPN client on my computer. However,
  the UF VPN page should have the most up-to-date and accurate
  information about UF VPN, and you should always refer to and follow the
  instructions on UF's web page.

<p>
  Perhaps you already have a different VPN client running on your computer.
  Only the UF VPN client will work for this course. If you have a different
  VPN client running, you will need to turn off your existing VPN client and
  turn on your UF VPN client every time you need to connect to the UNIX
  server for this course.
