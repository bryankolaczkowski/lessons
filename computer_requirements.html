<h1>What computer do I need to complete this course?</h1>

<h5 class="w3-padding-32 w3-text-grey">
  You need a computer connected to the internet.
</h5>

<p>
  Other than that, the computing requirements are extremely minimal.
  Most students will have a standard laptop computer with a wireless
  internet connection. This is what we recommend. You do not need
  much 'computing power', as all the actual computation will be done
  on a remote server.
</p>

<p>
  You'll almost certainly need a keyboard and a screen. A tablet would
  probably work fine, but you'd likely appreciate an external keyboard,
  as you'll be typing some code throughout the course. You could even
  complete the entire course using your phone, although you might suffer
  undue eye and finger strain!

<h1>What software do I need to complete this course?</h1>

<h5 class="w3-padding-32 w3-text-grey">
  You need a fairly up-to-date web browser.
</h5>

<p>
  Most of what you will be doing in this course will be handled through your
  web browser, which should come pre-bundled with whatever computer you are
  using. Guess what, you're already using your browser to view this course
  page, so if it's working, why fix it!
</p>

<p>
  Personally, I use the
  <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/" target="_blank">
  mozilla firefox</a> browser, which is free and available for a variety of
  operating systems and computing platforms. I test all the course material
  using this browser. But really, any browser should be fine, so there is no
  need to run out and download a new browser just for this course. Most
  operating systems come with their own browser, which should be fine.
</p>

<p>
  Speaking of operating systems, just about any should work. Most students
  will have either microsoft windows or apple's mac os. Google's chrome os
  should work fine, as would ios or android (we don't recommend
  completing this course on your phone, but you could do it). Personally,
  I use the linux operating system, which is a free UNIX-like os and the
  same operating system used by our course server and many high-performance
  computers. If you are using linux, great, but it isn't a requirement.
</p>

<p>
  You should
  keep your operating system fairly up-to-date, primarily for security
  reasons, but having the latest version of your os is probably not that
  important for this course.
